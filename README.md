# RLE-compressor
Run-length encoding (RLE)  in C. 
Is a form of lossless data compression in which consecutive occurrences of the same data value (runs of data) are stored as a single occurrence of that data value and a count of its consecutive occurrences. For this project a basic file compression was implimented using bytewise operations  pointers, and file streams
